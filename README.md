# chat-app-node.js-socket.io-
how to use this app on your computer:
- first you need to have node.js and npm installed
- then open a terminal window in the project's folder
- type in "npm install" to install the dependencies of the project
- then type "node app.js"
- you can now open your prefered navigator and type in the url bar "http://localhost:3000"
- open two separate windows, type two names when asked for them
- and finally start chatting ! (with yourself...)

I made this simple web app to get familiar with node.js, and socket.io. 
It is part of my learning of javascript and web development.
